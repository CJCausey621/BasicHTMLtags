    <h2><i>   This Class is Super Neat</i></h2>
    <h3>    And let me tell you why!</h3>
    <p>The following is a short list of why I personally think that everyone who works for Eleven Fifty Academy deserves a raise, and that the school is doing great things for the community.
        <p>(<i>And no, of course I'm not just trying to improve my grade!</i>)</p>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>I didn't have to pay a thing!</b></li>
        <dt><i>-and thats good because I'm broke!</i></dt>
        <li><b>I get to stay at home!</b></li>
        <dt><i>-going to a big building is intimidating</i></dt>
        <li><b>The class environment is very friendly!</b></li>
        <dt><i>-everyone is very understanding</i></dt>
        <li><b>The instructors rock!</b></li>
        <dt><i>-I'm serious, you guys are rad dope!!</i></dt>
